### Interpretable Machine Learning 【1】

>**Definition**
>- Interpretability is the degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision
>- Interpretability is the degree to which a human can consistently predict the model’s result
>
>**Importance of Interpretability**
>- **Human curiosity and learning**: Humans have a mental model of their environment that is updated when something unexpected happens.
>- Closely related to learning is the human desire to **find meaning in the world**.
>- The **goal of science** is to gain knowledge, but many problems are solved with big datasets and black box machine learning models.
>- Machine learning models take on real-world tasks that require **safety measures** and testing.
>- Interpretability is a useful debugging tool for **detecting bias** in machine learning models.
>- The process of integrating machines and algorithms into our daily lives requires interpretability to increase **social acceptance**.
>- Explanations are used to **manage social interactions**. 
>- Machine learning models can only be **debugged and audited** when they can be interpreted. 
>- **Fairness, Privacy, Reliability or Roubustness, Causality, Trust**
>
>**Taxonomy of Intetpretability Methods**
